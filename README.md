# tithe-summarizer
Quick Scripts and UI for Summarizing TIthing Data from Church Givers

data_cleaner.py - cleans up raw tithing data in a directory and compiles it all to one cleaned csv file for the whole year
data_summarizer.py - quick script to gather summary of tithes by person, by method, etc. 

A UI is quickly prototyped in streamlit that can visually show the tithing data through tables and charts for ease of use. 
This project is primarily useful to automate tax reports at the end of the year when we need to figure out how much each person tithed
in a specific year so that they can get a charitable donation form.
